# ðŸ“„ Design Guidelines: Saad.dev

## Visual Style

* **Font**: Inter (modern, highly readable for news content)
* **Primary Color**: `#1A73E8` (Google blue for tech-focused tone)
* **Accent Color**: `#F2F2F2` (neutral backdrop for content blocks)
* **Light Mode**: Clean white backgrounds
* **Dark Mode**: Soft black backgrounds with white/gray text

## Layout Principles

* **Card-Based Layout**: Articles appear as cards in grids or vertical stacks
* **Whitespace**: Generous padding and margins to reduce cognitive load
* **Hierarchy**: Clear visual hierarchy using font sizes and contrast
* **Image Use**: Hero images for posts should be crisp, relevant, and mobile-friendly

## Accessibility and Mobile-First Design

* Ensure all text has sufficient contrast
* Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles for navigation, forms, and article structures
* Touch-friendly buttons and tap targets

* Buttons: Rounded with subtle shadows, hover effects, and transition animations
* Article Cards: Title, excerpt, image thumbnail, category tag
* Toggle Switch: Elegant light/dark toggle saved in localStorage

## Brand Tone and Voice

* Professional but friendly and approachable
* Clear, concise writing that respects reader time
* No clickbait; titles should be informative and honest
* Consistent tone across homepage, articles, and newsletter copy
