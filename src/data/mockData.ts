    excerpt: 'Explore how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing web development and what it means for developers in 2025.',
    content: `
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming the landscape of web development. From automated code generation to intelligent debugging, AI tools are becoming indispensable for modern developers.</p>
      
      <h2>AI-Powered Development Tools</h2>
      <p>Tools like GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and ChatGPT are changing how we write code. These AI assistants can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generate boilerplate code automatically</li>
        <li>Suggest optimizations and improvements</li>
        <li>Help debug complex issues</li>
        <li>Translate code between different languages</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Impact on Developer Workflow</h2>
      <p>AI is not replacing developers but augmenting their capabilities. By automating repetitive tasks, developers can focus on more creative and strategic aspects of software development.</p>
      
      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated tools that understand context better and provide more intelligent suggestions. The key is to embrace these tools while continuing to develop fundamental programming skills.</p>

    content: `
      <p>TypeScript has become the de facto standard for building large-scale React applications. Here are the best practices you should follow.</p>
      
      <h2>Project Structure</h2>
      <p>Organize your project with a clear folder structure that scales:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Components organized by feature</li>
        <li>Shared utilities and hooks in dedicated folders</li>
        <li>Type definitions in a centralized location</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Type Safety</h2>
      <p>Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors early and improve developer experience.</p>
      
      <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
      <p>Use React's built-in optimization techniques along with TypeScript for maximum performance.</p>
